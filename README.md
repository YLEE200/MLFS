# Isn’t technology meant to help people and business?  What about Machine Learning?

It is surprisingly common in financial industry, especially for those companies with long histories, that has not been super-accepting “emerging technologies” including machine learning for a few reasons.
First, constant uneasiness has risen when financial decision makings by, for example, “black box” machine learning algorithms have not necessarily connected the dots between transparency and trust.  This further complicates what many financial institutions must do these days and ages: regulation, compliance, privacy and data security.  Heard about GDPR? Who wants to put their PII data into cloud because it is a cool technology?  Much related to transparency and trust context, it has been and will be significant financial and technical challenges and we need to handle these issues properly in order to remain survived in this fiercely competitive market.
Second, let’s be honest… No one is going to take on new tech in a full scale, while there are “legacy” technologies still being the under-pinning of many core business processes.  There are huge costs (financial and non-financial) involved to even divest the legacy technologies.  ROI estimation exercise has become challenging as a few bold POCs ended inconclusive and as the quantification of financial benefits was, in many cases, not feasible enough to build much-aligned roadmaps.  In addition, this caused the distraction for the people who have been in the industry long enough to leverage the business insight through old tech, which further brings about organizational demarcation between business and non-business functions (many of you know how hard we have fought against this issue by adopting integrative technologies such as ERP, BI tools, and sometimes thru unofficial shadow IT organization existed in the line of businesses).
Third, there have been many researches/studies published and hyped, which doesn’t necessarily focus on practical business use cases. Well… you may argue there are many use cases out there such as AML, fraud detection, customer service, underwriting, etc.  Large financial companies are eager, but they have to be very pragmatic at the same time.  Meaning.. the speed of adoption is anywhere close to what many folks believed it would be. In addition, the rapid changes in emerging and disruptive technologies in recent years have been constantly distracting companies’ strategic directions.
 
## So, what’s up with Machine Learning?

To make a long story short, we all know we need to do it.   And, we need to start from somewhere.
Things are moving really fast these days...  Machine Learning, ANN, TensorFlow...  You may have heard about them, and perhaps some of you can articulate the concepts pretty well.  As a matter of fact, there are growing number of insightful and influential business folks in financial services (some happen to be investment decision-makers) out there that are quite interested in machine learning (with AI and cognitive technologies), but they are not necessarily familiar with machine learning in a technical level.  Therefore, their judgment on its adoption has been heavily relied upon those of the folks in decision science or IT departments.  Here comes the organizational separation in decision-making process as I mentioned above.

So, what can you do at an individual level?

It is critical to understand how practical and relevant for those machine learning techniques in terms of tackling common business problems.  I am certain, whether you are a data scientist or a data analyst or just a BI person, having a bit more details and hands-on experience in how machine learning algorithms work and can apply to business problems will help your career and your business to cope with ever-fast changing competition in the midst of 4th Industrial Revolution.  You will find it surprisingly easy to comprehend the codes as there are huge amount of information and technical details online, owing to open-source efforts these days, and I will take a step-by-step approach for you to follow along.
Taking these perspectives, I want to start from somewhere...  I am going to post a series of blogs that introduce a few tutorial-like python notebooks that address typical business problems such as default prediction, fraud prevention or customer contact strategy.

My plan is to cover following topics (subject to change)
1.	Unstructured Data & “Shallow” Learning 
1.	Artificial Neural Networks
1.	Supervised & Unsupervised Machine Learning
1.	Feature Selection

More to come and Stay tuned!
