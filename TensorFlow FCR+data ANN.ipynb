Deep-learning is gaining great momentum these days as those enable users to tackle various modeling challenges that we were not able to easily address such as image recognition.

    "TensorFlowâ„¢ is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. TensorFlow was developed by the Google Brain team for internal Google use. It was released under the Apache 2.0 open source license on 9 November 2015. The name of the library help us understand how we work with it. Basically, tensors are multidimensional arrays that flow through the nodes of a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the data flow graphs, nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well.\n",

In a simplest concept, you may want to think about a simple linear function expressed in Y = mX + c, where m is for slope and c is for constant.  Then, simply replace that with Y = wX + b, where w is a matrix of weights and b is a bias. Think of the weights as importance you assign to each feature (row of an input). Bias is independent of features. If the bias for that row (category) is high, then the score for that row will be higher.\n",

The tf.random_normal initializer generates a random distribution with a given mean and standard deviation.  As you see below, the dimensions become reduced as the data/flow progresses. Often the features in the hidden layers are not easily interpretable by humans. \n",
